```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(benford.analysis) # loads package data(corporate.payment) # loads data
#This step is to find datasets provided in the package.
d <- data(package = "benford.analysis")
## names of data sets in the package
#d$results[, "Item"]
data(census.2009)

census1 <- benford(census.2009$pop.2009, number.of.digits = 1, sign = "positive", discrete = TRUE, round = 3)
census2 <- benford(census.2009$pop.2009, number.of.digits = 2, sign = "positive", discrete = TRUE, round = 3)
plot(census1)
plot(census2)
```
By looking at the general information of the dataset. We can see that the values of mean, variance, Ex.Kurtosis and skewness well match with the expected values of 0.5
```{r}
census
```


```{r}
#This step is to find the suspicious targets.
suspects <- getSuspects(census, census.2009)
suspects
```

From the suspect function, we can see that Alabama state has a handful of data that are suspicious.
